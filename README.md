A python project created to test my OOP knowledge/skills.
This program will simulate a library experience with several different types of books, each with their own attributes like languages and subjects.
There will also be a section for retro gaming to store different games, each game having its own attributes like subject, console platform, and studio. 
The user will be allowed to view a list of books/games as well as adding/removing ones of their choice.
