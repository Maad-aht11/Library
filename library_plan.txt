    Class variable: count of books, num of books checked_out.


Methods 
    Check out a book, return a book, pay a payment, and become
    a library member
 
Validation:  1. can only check out books which users meet the age rating 
             2. can only have 3 books checked out at once 
             3. After the return date if the book is not returned, 
                there will be a fee placed on the account
             4. If the user cannot return the book, they will pay the price of the book

    T - For 13 and older

User interface:
    1. Can see all library books offered
    2. Can see all library books available to be checked out (must require log in)
    3. Can access User profile if user has a profile
    3a. Can view all user information like books checked out, balance owned
    3b. Can preform actions on account like pay balance, ect. 
    4. Can create a user profile 

Notes: For this project I will be creating a list of books and attributes manually.
These will be stored as a csv file and read into the program.In the future, an 
API can be implemented instead for gathering book data. Also, this
project will assume that each book has one language its written in.
